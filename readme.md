# SentimentAnalysisML

This repository contains my research project focused on "Comparative Analysis of Classification Models on Text based Sentiment Analysis". We compare various classification models to analyze the sentiment expressed in text data and compared their performances.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text. This project aims to explore different machine learning classification models for sentiment analysis and compare their performance.

## Dataset

For this project, we used a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) of 1.6 million tweets. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyanshNegi/SentimentAnalysisText.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your preferred directory.

2. Open the Notebook in Google Colab
Go to the following link to open the notebook in Google Colab:

[Sentiment Analysis Notebook] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18hlkut6_OA1V-n-FqsvLLzlHoU84zyXW?usp=sharing)

Click on "Open in Colab" to launch the notebook in Google Colab.

3. Set Up the Environment
Once the notebook is open in Google Colab, you can run the cells to install any necessary dependencies or libraries. The notebook will guide you through the installation process if required.

4. Import and Analyze Data
To perform sentiment analysis, you need text data. You can either import your own dataset or use the provided [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset in the repository under Dataset. The notebook provides instructions on how to import and analyze the data, allowing you to understand its structure and gain insights.

5. Preprocess the Text
Text preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis. The notebook includes code snippets to preprocess the text data, such as removing stopwords, tokenizing, and converting text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

6. Train and Evaluate Models
The notebook offers various machine learning models for sentiment analysis. You can choose a model that suits your requirements or experiment with multiple models. Train the selected model on your preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

7. Interpret and Visualize Results
Interpreting and visualizing the results of sentiment analysis is essential for understanding the sentiment expressed in the text data. The notebook provides code snippets for interpreting and visualizing the results, including generating word clouds, sentiment distributions, and accuracy scores.

8. Customize and Experiment
Feel free to customize the notebook according to your specific requirements. You can experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature engineering approaches, or machine learning algorithms to improve the sentiment analysis results.

9. Save and Share
Once you have completed your analysis and achieved satisfactory results, save the modified notebook. You can share the notebook with others for collaboration or refer back to it in the future.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook that enables you to perform sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. By following the steps outlined above, you can get started with sentiment analysis, analyze text data, train models, interpret sentiment, and visualize the results. Happy sentiment analysis!
